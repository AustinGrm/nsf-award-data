<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Lead ID: DMR/BMAT(7623) 0804464                Lead PI: Stanciu, Lia      ORG: Purdue&lt;br/&gt;Non-Lead ID: DMR/BMAT(7623) 0804506      Non-Lead PI: Andreescu, Emanuela ORG: Clarkson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:  Biomagnetic Glasses:  Preparation, Characterization, and Biosensor Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The goal of this proposal is to create a generic approach for the fabrication of biofunctional materials with magnetic capabilities, so called "biomagnetic glasses." These will be used in the design of highly stable, magnetically separable enzyme-based systems. The project focuses on creating hybrid composite materials containing enzymes, magnetic nanoparticles, and silica glasses and on the development of generic strategies that will be used to prepare these materials.  Three enzymes have been selected as model examples: horseradish peroxidase (HRP), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).  As an example of proposed applications, the AChE based biomagnetic glasses will be suitable for use as the sensing component in the development of a cheap and autonomously operating bioanalytical device for detecting pesticides in food products, agricultural fields and other security situations.  It is proposed that the magnetic properties of the sensor materials will permit them to be localized with respect to the potential analytes using permanent magnets.  The specific objectives of the project are: (1) synthesize and characterize silica-iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles with controlled microstructure and properties. (Purdue); (2) encapsulate model enzymes (HRP, AChE, G6PDH) within the silica magnetic nanocomposites and monitor the biocatalytic activity and stability (Purdue); (3) use screen printed electrodes to exploit the biomagnetic glasses in biosensors (Clarkson); (4) build calibration plots of the biosensors upon application of various concentrations of target analytes (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, pesticides, glucose-6-phosphate) (Clarkson).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Bio-based sensor technology that is sensitive and selective across a broad dynamic range remains in great demand for analysis of chemical species in biotech process streams, in the environment, and in the security area.  This proposal addresses, in particular, the issue of useful lifetime of enzyme-based biosensors.  The project provides an excellent platform for multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students.  Both PIs encourage undergraduate participation; funding for support of undergraduates is included in the Clarkson budget.  The Purdue-based PI plans to incorporate materials on biosensors in courses that she teaches in the two Schools of which she is a member.  Both PIs will engage in outreach to local public schools.  At Clarkson these relationships are established and on-going, while the PI at Purdue is developing the necessary relationships with the school system.  She is also active in the Purdue Women in Engineering program and has been successful in recruiting female students into her research group.  Both PIs demonstrate a sensitivity toward broadening participation among underrepresented minority students.  The PIs are connected with ongoing minority recruitment programs on their respective campuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
