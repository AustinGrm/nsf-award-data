<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0820826&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Fermi Research Alliance, LLC&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY ? ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL USER&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Chou, Weiren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Support for Young US Scientists Attending the 2008 International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders was held May 19-27, 2006 in Sokendai, Japan. The second one was October 1-10, 2007 in Erice, Sicily, Italy. Both schools were very successful. These schools were jointly organized by the International Linear Collider Global Design Effort (ILC GDE), the International Collider Steering Committee (ILCSC), and the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) Beam Dynamics Panel. These schools were generously sponsored by major laboratories and funding agencies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. They gave young people (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young researchers) from all over the world the opportunity to learn about future high energy physics projects, namely, the ILC and CLIC. The interest was enormous. The first school received more than 500 applications and the second one about 250 applications. These applicants were competing for the 70 available spaces, which were limited by the capacity of the school. Based on the successes of the first two LC schools and demand from the world accelerator community, the ILC GDE and ICFA decided to continue the school series and have a third one in 2008 in the U.S. It will take place October 19 to 29, 2008 at the Oak Brook Hills Marriott Hotel near Chicago, Illinois. The school has an Organizing Committee chaired by Barry Barish, Director of the ILC GDE, and a Curriculum Committee chaired by Weiren Chou, Chair of the ICFA Beam Dynamics Panel. The number of participants and format will be similar to the previous LC schools. This award will provide partial support for the young scientists and students.]]></AbstractNarration>
