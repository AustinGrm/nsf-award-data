<AbstractNarration>The Future Directions in Genetics Studies workshop is a four day graduate training workshop for students of history, philosophy, and social studies of biology, with an emphasis on behavioral genetics. It seeks to explore new avenues for HPS research by exploring the interface of neuroscience and genetics by bringing together researchers who specialize in these areas. Eight to twelve researchers of distinction from the fields of HPS of biology will be invited to give plenary talks addressing the specific questions: What exactly does it mean to say that there is "a gene for" a specific trait or behavior? How do genes carry information? And who should have access to such information? How should research at the interface between genetics and neuroscience best be conducted? How can philosophers, historians, sociologists, and geneticists collaborate to contribute to the future of genetic studies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very little work has been done in the HPS of behavioral genetics. The incorporation of neuron-scientific work that relates to behavioral genetics, and broader issues of interest in the history and philosophy of science, can be expected to expand both the range of scholars involved and the possible topics for future collaboration. The conference will bring graduate students of different fields together to discuss their research and gain fresh perspectives on their work. The desired result is to help PhD candidates make contact with cutting edge research, to see that their work can have broad appeal, and to encourage them to make their research accessible to those in other fields who could benefit from their work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this workshop is designed around training graduates students in the HPS of genetics, one primary goal of this workshop is to create an environment where graduate students can feel comfortable participating as full members of the academic community. The organizers promote the use of "happy office hours" wherein faculty members make themselves available at a specific time and location such as a coffeehouse, restaurant, or classroom for students to drop in and make informal contacts or discuss research ideas. This effectively creates lots of time for interaction between student and faculty researchers for thinking together. In addition, the organizers are actively recruiting speakers from underrepresented groups, especially women. The inclusion of neuroscientists and psychologists in discussions with members of the HPS community promises an expansion of disciplines including new topics for discussion and new lines of research.</AbstractNarration>
