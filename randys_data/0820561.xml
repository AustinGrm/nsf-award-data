<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[ID: MPS/DMR/CER(1774) 0801520        PI: Faber, Katherine     ORG: Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Student Support for 2nd International Congress on Ceramics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Funds are awarded to support the travel and registration fees for up to eight US students (including both graduate and undergraduate students) to the 2nd International Congress on Ceramics to be held June 29 ? July 4, 2008, in Verona, Italy. This conference series was initiated in 2006 by a consortium consisting of the American Ceramic Society, the European Ceramic Society, and the Ceramic Society of Japan to facilitate discussion and planning concerning major issues that face the international ceramics and glass industry.  The 2nd Congress is organized by the European Ceramic Society under the purview of the International Ceramics Federation.  Over 100 international experts have been invited to make presentations. Following the example set by the 1st International Congress on Ceramics, the organizers plan to publish a revised version of the "Global Roadmap for Ceramics."  Only students who will be presenting posters at the Congress will be considered for support.  Selection of student participants will be based on the quality of the abstract submitted and a letter of recommendation from the student's research advisor.  Availability of support will be advertised through the Material Advantage website and direct contact with Material Advantage advisors in universities and colleges throughout the US.  A panel of judges chosen from American Ceramic Society membership will be used to evaluate nominations.  Consideration will be given to diversity (both for females and underrepresented minorities) for the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  Substantial benefit will accrue to the US student participants who are enabled by this grant to attend the 2nd International Congress on Ceramics.  They will have an opportunity to present their own research in a high level scientific environment where both their scientific accomplishment and their communication skills are put to a demanding test.  And they will be able to meet both junior and senior colleagues in the ceramics field from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
