<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[College of Menominee Nation, a tribal college located in Keshena, WI, has successfully completed the &lt;br/&gt;objectives and strategies of its Phase I:  STEM Curriculum Enhancement Project.  The College proposes &lt;br/&gt;to continue the expansion and growth of its STEM programming and curriculum through a Phase II: &lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary STEM Advancement Project. NSF funding will allow College of Menominee Nation to &lt;br/&gt;continue contributing to both the significant broader impacts of Tribal College STEM achievements as &lt;br/&gt;well as to the support and critical promotion of Native Americans in STEM employment fields  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;CMN?s Phase II goal is:  To continue to strengthen and build CMN?s capacity to provide competitive &lt;br/&gt;STEM programming and services.  Anticipated Phase II impacts include 1.) Increasing the number of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented STEM majors; 2.) Increasing STEM student retention; 3.) Increasing the number of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented STEM graduates; 4.) Increasing the number of underrepresented students who enroll &lt;br/&gt;in baccalaureate degree granting institutions; and 5.) Increasing the number of underrepresented &lt;br/&gt;minorities entering the STEM workforce.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Phase II objectives and strategies build upon the sturdy foundation of Phase I successes and follow a &lt;br/&gt;natural progression of development.  The objectives and strategies are as follows: &lt;br/&gt;1. Objective One: To advance existing STEM programs revised, expanded or developed in Phase I.  &lt;br/&gt;Strategies include developing and implementing advanced STEM courses in mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;science, continue developing the Materials Science Program linked to Menominee expertise in &lt;br/&gt;forests, expanding faculty and student STEM resources available at CMN, and further integrating &lt;br/&gt;technology into STEM courses. &lt;br/&gt;2. Objective Two: To increase faculty capacity through advanced degree support for two faculty &lt;br/&gt;members and general professional development for STEM faculty.  Strategies include supporting &lt;br/&gt;one faculty member in earning a Master?s degree, supporting another in earning a doctorate, and &lt;br/&gt;supporting general professional development of STEM faculty.  &lt;br/&gt;3. Objective Three: To develop and implement additional STEM student research, internships, and &lt;br/&gt;exposure opportunities.  Strategies include developing and implementing student research and &lt;br/&gt;internship activities, supporting a student exchange program with Belize, and supporting student &lt;br/&gt;travel to major research labs and key STEM association meetings. &lt;br/&gt;4. Objective Four: To continue to provide and expand demonstrated successful STEM student &lt;br/&gt;support activities.  Strategies include supporting a STEM student advisor, supporting STEM &lt;br/&gt;tutors, supporting the STEM scholars program and developing the STEM honors program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
