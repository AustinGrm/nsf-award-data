<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[&lt;br/&gt;Understanding symbols in political discourse is important because symbols shape how policy problems and options are framed. This project focuses on understanding the origins, evolution, and dynamics of the concept of "basic research" in science policy discourse.  The exact phrase can be seen as a political symbol representing a concept that has otherwise been characterized as pure research, fundamental research, and transformative research, among other terms.  The term "basic research" did not exist prior to the 1920s and currently appears to be falling out of favor.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic is of current interest because science policy discussions in Europe and the United States are now characterized by changing language and symbols, and the concept of "basic research" appears to be a causality of this change.  In Europe the phrase "fundamental research" has gained some traction whereas in the United States, particularly in the NSF, the phrase "transformational research" has some traction. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of the proposed research are varied.  The origins of the concept of "basic research" will be of interest to scholars of science and science policy, but will also inform understandings of the evolution of science policies and contemporary debates.  An obvious example of the practical implications of such understandings is how R&amp;D budgets are accounted for in the United States.  For many years these budgets have been categorized based on a framework where projects are categorized according to the concepts of basic and applied research.  If the language of science policy changes to disfavor "basic research" as an important concept, is this change merely cosmetic?  Or are there substantive implications for how we organize and think about the domains of science and innovation policy? These questions cut to the core of organization and policy in the National Science Foundation, but also other agencies of government that support R&amp;D, including science agencies in countries across the world.  The research will be broadly disseminated and prepared in such a manner so as to contribute to education and contemporary policy discussions.&lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
