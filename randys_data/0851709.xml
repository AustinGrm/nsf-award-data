<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a renewal of the previously funded REU Site NSF Award No. 0552758. This 10 week REU Site program in MAS-net (Mobile Actuator Sensor Networks) provides eight undergraduate students an opportunity to participate in the ongoing research activities of faculty members in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Utah State University. This early exposure to research activities substantially furthers the undergraduates? learning process, significantly enhances their research experience, actively promotes their interests in MAS-net related research, and quickly develops their research skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed work is focused on several MAS-net related techniques and their importance in interesting and crucial applications of high interest to the student participants. The work addresses challenging issues in the field of MAS-net using hands-on and stimulating research projects such as: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Development of Consensus Algorithms for Coordination of Multiple Robotic Vehicles, &lt;br/&gt;2. Development of Plume Tracking Algorithms with Networked Mobile Sensors &lt;br/&gt;3. Development of Design Methods for Swarm Emergent Behaviors in MAS-net. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site applies an intellectual approach to encourage REU students in active learning, free and open exchange of ideas, team spirit, and recognition and rewards for achievements. In addition to the research, the REU students participate in weekly individual meetings, weekly research group meetings, bi-weekly REU group meetings, bi-weekly ?expanding your horizon? seminars, and social events. They learn to assimilate latest research, assess their own research, present their own work and experimental results, prepare publications, and prepare for admission to graduate school (GRE preparation tutorials). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research directly helps undergraduate students by: &lt;br/&gt;1. Exposing them to the intellectual excitement involved in research and professional meetings; &lt;br/&gt;2. Teaching them to think creatively and independently in a ?learn by doing? research environment; &lt;br/&gt;3. Empowering them with general research methods, and specific MAS-net skills; &lt;br/&gt;4. Giving  them hands-on experience in real world applications, and teaching them to apply MAS-net related technologies to real-world problems; &lt;br/&gt;5. Teaching them to effectively assimilate latest research, critically assess their own research, cogently present experimental results, and effectively prepare publications; and &lt;br/&gt;6. Helping them to establish a sense of self-assurance and team-spirit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research are to: &lt;br/&gt;1. Attract a diverse student population to the field of MAS-net. &lt;br/&gt;2. Kindle students? interests in the area of MAS-net. &lt;br/&gt;3. Increase the number of future professionals in the area of MAS-net. &lt;br/&gt;4. Stimulate enrollments in graduate studies. &lt;br/&gt;5. Promote collaborative ties between students? home institutions and USU. &lt;br/&gt;6. Provide a basis for future cooperative studies and research opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least four of the eight participants are underrepresented students and at least four students are from other institutions, recruited from those institutions where research programs are limited. This active national and regional recruitment plan helps underrepresented students and students with limited exposure to research to be acquainted with interesting research projects and to gain confidence in their pursuit of baccalaureate degrees, in seeking industrial technology related jobs, and in continuing to advanced degree programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
