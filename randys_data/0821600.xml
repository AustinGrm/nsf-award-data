<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Non-Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College, located on contiguous campuses in Atlanta Georgia, propose to establish the joint Morehouse College - Clark Atlanta University Magnetic Resonance Facility to serve the research and educational needs of students, faculty and research staff.  Pursuant to this goal these institutions have jointly submitted to the National Science Foundation this NSF-MRI proposal to acquire a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer.  The two institutions have a long history of providing the Country with a source of highly trained and talented minority scientists. The utilization of this Facility will impact the quality of courses provided to both undergraduate and graduate students.  Its utilization by undergraduates involved in research, graduate students developing their theses and dissertations and research staff and faculty will impact the quality and broaden the scope of their investigations.  Nuclear magnetic resonance has the ability to reveal the composition and structure of substances at the molecular level and is thus an essential tool in tackling problems in areas as diverse as how living system function and the adsorbants on catalysts.  Furthermore, the availability of this instrument will permit the researchers at both Institutions to significantly contribute to the solutions of complex scientific and technological problems by undertaking investigations that will deliver on the promise of science in the service of humankind.  The purchase of the 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and the establishment of the Morehouse College - Clark Atlanta University Magnetic Resonance Facility is an integral part of the strategic plan to increase the research capacity and competitiveness of these two Institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College, located on contiguous campuses in Atlanta Georgia, propose to establish the joint Morehouse College - Clark Atlanta University Magnetic Resonance Facility to serve the research and educational needs of students, faculty and research staff.  Pursuant to this goal these institutions have jointly submitted to the National Science Foundation this NSF-MRI proposal to acquire a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer.  The utilization of this Facility will impact the quality of courses provided to both undergraduate and graduate students.  Its utilization by undergraduates involved in research, graduate students developing their theses and dissertations and research staff and faculty will impact the quality and broaden the scope of their investigations.   The ongoing and anticipated research programs that will be positively impacted by the establishment of this Center include: work in material synthesis and characterization, nanobiotechnology, organic and polymer synthesis, enzyme structure-function studies and catalysis.   Among the specific research projects that will benefit from the acquisition of the 500 MHz spectrometer are the:&lt;br/&gt;? Synthesis and modification of zeolites and related micro and mesoporous aluminosilicate and organosilicates for applications as adsorbents, catalysts, and components of nanocomposites&lt;br/&gt;? Towards a Better Biodiesel: Scope and reactivity of low-valent transition metal complexes in the hydrogenation, amination, and carbonylation of non-olefinic substrates&lt;br/&gt;? Design and preparation of functional nanoscale materials for controlling and understanding material-protein and material-cell interaction &lt;br/&gt;The purchase of the 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and the establishment of the MCMRF is an integral part of the strategic plan to increase the research capacity and competitiveness of these Institutions.]]></AbstractNarration>
