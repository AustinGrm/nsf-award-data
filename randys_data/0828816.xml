<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[RICHARD N. ZARE      Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Richard N. Zare is the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor in Natural Science at Stanford University. He is Chair of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Professor. Professor Zare is renowned for his research in the area of laser chemistry, resulting in a greater understanding of chemical reactions at the molecular level. By experimental and theoretical studies he has made seminal contributions to our knowledge of molecular collision processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Richard Zare's mentoring interests are directed at improving opportunities for all students, but he is passionate about gender and ethnic equity in STEM. He has developed a stellar 40 year career as a scientist, educator, and leader in public science. Some of his distinguished recognitions include receiving the National Medal of Science, the National Academy of Sciences award in Chemistry and serving as a member of the National Science Board. He has had a national impact as a role model and author and his interests and career success place him in the position to serve as a role model for effective mentoring of women and minorities in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He has mentored 49 postdocs and graduate students who are women or minorities. Of these, 17 became faculty in chemistry or physics. The addition of this number of minority faculty from a tier one research institution could have a profound effect on the higher education community. The minority students mentored by Dr. Zare are very diverse, with African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islanders and Native American being represented. These student outcomes represent a significant contribution to the science and academe workforce as well as meaningful membership of women and underrepresented minorities in the scientific enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Zare has recognized that gender discrimination is embedded in our culture. Through presentations and articles, he has endorsed the use of Title IX to address the lack of equity in science, just as the federal law has been used to promote equity in athletics. Within two months of becoming Chair of the Chemistry Department at Stanford University, Dr. Zare announced what may have been the country's most generous maternity-leave policy for graduate students in chemistry. Dr. Zare worked with the Stanford University Clayman Institute for Gender Research and the Stanford Chemistry Woman's Committee on Graduate Life (WCGL) to develop a questionnaire to examine practices, attitudes and behaviors towards gender issues in science.]]></AbstractNarration>
