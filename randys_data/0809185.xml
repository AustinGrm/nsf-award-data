<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[0809185&lt;br/&gt;Sigmund&lt;br/&gt;This project supports collaborative research by Dr.  Wolfgang Sigmund, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville and Dr. Reda Ouf, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute (CMRDI), Helwan, Egypt.  The objective of this project is a study on ?Magnetic Nano-composite as Photocatalysts Prepared by Sol-Gel Technique for Degradation of Organic Dyes?. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Merit: The pollution of water resources by sewage and industrial wastes with toxic or organic compounds presents a serious problem. TiO2 nanoparticles have large specific surface areas and high catalytic performance allow reactions to convert these compounds in presence of UV light on their surface. However, their effective commercial applications are hindered by two serious disadvantages. The first is the agglomeration of the nano-powders resulting in an adverse effect on catalyst performance. The second is the separation and recovery of TiO2 nano-powders from wastewater is difficult. The aim of this project is to develop a photocatalyst that is magnetic, photoactive, and stable using a wet synthesis method, for easy removal and recovery from slurry-type photoreactor. Specific aims include: (i) developing a reproducible synthesis method based on the sol-gel process for preparing magnetic photocatalyst, by coating a magnetic material with TiO2; (ii) characterizing the physical and chemical properties of the prepared samples, and (iii) studying their photocatalytic performance by degrading dye as the model organic compound The intellectual merit of this proposal is an enhanced understanding of magnetic photocatalytic nanocomposites for degradation of organic compounds that might be useful for environmental remediation.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The broader impact is the education of graduate and undergraduate students in the U.S. and the education of young Egyptian researchers thus fostering the international bonds&lt;br/&gt;between Egypt and the US.  Furthermore, the exchange program will provide a scientific&lt;br/&gt;and cultural experience for the US undergraduate and graduate students that allows them to grow into teachers for other US students and bring international experience to the companies or government units that they will work with in the future. Additionally, the photocatalysts, if proven successful, can be applied in the U.S., in Egypt or other developing countries to purify water and remediate the environment.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. &lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
