<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[0519415&lt;br/&gt;Vuille&lt;br/&gt;The tropical Andes are one of the regions of the globe where recent climate change is&lt;br/&gt;most evident, consistent with the notion that high-elevation mountain ranges that extend into the&lt;br/&gt;mid-troposphere will experience greater warming. As a result glaciers are receding throughout the&lt;br/&gt;tropical Andes, with potentially severe consequences for the availability of drinking water, and&lt;br/&gt;water for irrigation, mining and hydropower production.&lt;br/&gt;General Circulation Models (GCMs) run with a 2.CO2 scenario predict an additional&lt;br/&gt;warming of more than 2.5.C by the end of the century. However large uncertainties exist about&lt;br/&gt;these future projections, especially because the coarse resolution of GCMs is inadequate to&lt;br/&gt;resolve the meso- and local-scale circulation features associated with the steep Andean&lt;br/&gt;topography. To accurately understand and predict future climate change and its impact on tropical&lt;br/&gt;Andean glaciers, higher resolution models and a better simulation of variables other than&lt;br/&gt;temperature are required.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to simulate climate variability and change in the Andes under both presentday&lt;br/&gt;conditions (1961-90 and 1958-2001) and two different IPCC-SRES emission scenarios&lt;br/&gt;(2071-2100) with a regional climate model (PRECIS) to gain a better understanding of how&lt;br/&gt;future climate change might affect tropical Andean glaciers.&lt;br/&gt;Results from our regional climate model will be validated with observational data from&lt;br/&gt;space before they are used as input into a glacier-climate model (ITGG 2.0) to simulate how&lt;br/&gt;glacier mass balance will be affected by future climate change. The simulated present-day mass&lt;br/&gt;balance of selected glaciers will be compared with observational records from the tropical Andes&lt;br/&gt;to verify the accuracy of our results. To gain a better understanding of the consequences of&lt;br/&gt;glacier retreat, the ITGG 2.0 model will also be used to simulate changes in runoff from Andean&lt;br/&gt;watersheds. The anticipated results of our proposed research are:&lt;br/&gt;1) The use of a high-resolution model will improve simulations of climate in this area of complex&lt;br/&gt;terrain and yield more accurate predictions of future climate change than are available to date&lt;br/&gt;from GCM.s.&lt;br/&gt;2) An in-depth model validation with observational data will lead to a better assessment of model&lt;br/&gt;performance (for both the RCM and the ITGG 2.0).&lt;br/&gt;3) We will for the first time establish robust projections of how glaciation and runoff will change&lt;br/&gt;in this region at the end of the 21st century. This has important implications for the anticipated&lt;br/&gt;future water shortage in the region and will provide much needed information to implement&lt;br/&gt;adaptation and mitigation strategies.&lt;br/&gt;4) Finally we anticipate a significant model improvement as a result of using regional climate&lt;br/&gt;model data instead of course resolution reanalysis data as input into the ITGG 2.0 model.&lt;br/&gt;We strongly believe that our proposed research addresses a key issue related to future&lt;br/&gt;climate change in the tropical Andes, which is of high scientific interest but also of primary&lt;br/&gt;socio-economic relevance for the region. The potential for a future water crisis is evident and this&lt;br/&gt;water shortage is related to a projected future change in runoff, due to the observed rapid glacier&lt;br/&gt;retreat. The scientific merit of this proposal is therefore to gain a better understanding of both&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms and consequences related to the disappearance of tropical Andean glaciers. This&lt;br/&gt;increased knowledge on how fast and how far glaciers will recede and how much this will affect&lt;br/&gt;future runoff and water availability from the Andes will have a significant and broad impact on&lt;br/&gt;local economies and populations. Without a better and much more detailed knowledge of how&lt;br/&gt;future climate change will affect glaciological and hydrological systems in the Andes, no&lt;br/&gt;mitigation and adaptation strategies can be put in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
