<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In this award, Dr. Hilty from Texas A&amp;M University will utilize the recently developed, commercially available Hypersense polarizer to create enhanced nuclear spin polarization through dynamic nuclear polarization from contact with organic radicals. Integration of stopped-flow methods will allow him to study dynamics in enzymatic processes and protein folding. Dr. Hilty's educational plan involves development of new demonstrations for the physical chemistry lecture course, and his participation in the "Chemistry Road Show" to reach out to high school students in rural areas of Texas. Dr. Hilty plans to develop science kits that can be delivered to the schools via postal service if neither he nor his students can pay a personal visit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of dynamic processes, that is, processes captured on the same time scale as they occur, is a challenging problem in chemistry when performed with molecular level resolution. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the sister technique to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is a powerful and wide-spread tool in chemistry to investigate molecular structure. Unfortunately, it does not lend itself very well to the study of dynamic processes, as these often involve intermediate species in small concentrations that NMR is not sufficiently sensitive to detect. So-called dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a clever technique that was devised in the 1950's to make NMR more sensitive - its downside is that it must be performed at very low temperatures, that is -456 F! At these temperatures, all molecules are frozen and dynamic processes come to a standstill. Since the DNP advantage disappears in a matter of seconds, the samples must be warmed up very rapidly so that dynamics can be studied. Dr. Hilty from Texas A&amp;M University has developed an apparatus that allows him to do exactly that - with it, he plans to investigate enzymatic reactions and the folding of proteins. These processes occur in our bodies every single day, and their dysfunction is responsible for many diseases such as Alzheimer's. &lt;br/&gt;College students must enroll in physical chemistry courses to be able to understand and do research such as Dr. Hilty's. The material is challenging with a strong mathematical component that makes it hard for students to establish connections with real-world phenomena. Dr. Hilty will improve the physical chemistry curriculum by developing demonstrations to be shared with other instructors to help students see these connections, ultimately resulting in better student learning and enthusiasm for the field. In order to engage students in this fascinating field earlier in their career, he partners with Texas A &amp; M's "Chemistry Road Show" that is taken to high schools in rural areas of TX. Dr. Hilty will enrich the show that is currently based on chemistry demonstrations by developing hands-on activities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;]]></AbstractNarration>
