<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Plants produce thousands of chemicals that are important to their growth, development and interaction with the environment. Many of these chemicals, such as glucosinolates, impact agricultural practice, human nutrition and health. Glucosinolates are a major group of thioglucosides with diverse biological activities, including defense against pathogens and insects. They are present in important Brassica crops as well as in the model plant Arabidopsis, which will be used for the proposed research. In order to engineer plants to improve crop quality and yield, create renewable energy and develop nutraceuticals, it will be essential to define the organization and connectivity of complex metabolic networks like those involved in glucosinolate production. The research team will use modern biological tools to understand the chemical networks that regulate plant glucosinolate metabolism. The project is expected to identify novel chemical components including proteins and metabolites and put them into functional context of glucosinolate metabolism. The research is expected to provide comprehensive knowledge of regulatory and metabolic mechanisms underlying glucosinolate metabolism that will help to develop crops with enhanced defense and improved quality. The approaches employed will provide technology development for future network analysis of other important plant pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to the scientific impacts, this project will involve multidisciplinary training of students at different levels, as well as bring current knowledge of the plant chemical factory and modern functional genomics to high school classrooms. Education and training of high school teachers and students will facilitate effective preparation of our next-generation scientists and citizens with cutting-edge biological sciences. Educational/training activities will be developed for high school students and teachers in functional genomics, including online functional genomics resources. The large-scale data generated by this project will provide excellent materials for active learning, critical thinking, and problem solving. Thus, the broader impacts include advancing the discovery and understanding of essential plant chemical processes and establishing a platform to expose modern scientific research and technologies to high school teachers and their students.]]></AbstractNarration>
