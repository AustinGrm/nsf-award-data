<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will highlight recent developments in commutative algebra, as well as its interactions with algebraic topology, group cohomology and representation theory. The conference will take place May 17-22, 2008 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The choice of topics and the selection of speakers recognizes the research contributions of Luchezar Avramov, as well as his many contributions to his students and postdoctoral mentees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature 20 one-hour lectures by internationally recognized researchers, plus 9-10 shorter talks by mathematically younger participants. In order to avoid parallel sessions and to allow ample time for informal mathematical interaction among the participants, the number of talks will be limited to 30. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 130 participants are expected from outside the University of Nebraska, in addition to about 25 local participants. Partial support for travel and lodging will be provided for domestic participants, with emphasis on mathematically young participants (early career and graduate students).  Participation by women and by members of underrepresented minorities will be particularly encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of commutative algebra is in a period of profound transformation. While its roots in algebraic geometry continue to supply tools, problems and intuition to commutative algebra itself, new connections to other areas have been discovered in the last twenty years. Currently commutative algebraists are involved in intense interactions with researchers in homotopy theory, cohomology of finite groups and representation theory. The conference will feature one-hour talks by twenty top researchers, eleven of them in commutative algebra per se, five in algebraic topology and rational homotopy theory, and four in representation theory and group cohomology. Many other researchers, established leaders, recent Ph.D.'s and advanced graduate students, will join these twenty main speakers for a week of intense mathematical interaction. One can expect many new insights, collaborations and discoveries as a result of this gathering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will help recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students to (i) interact with leading researchers in algebra, (ii) learn about recent developments in commutative algebra and related fields, (iii) exchange ideas with one another and (iv) develop collaborations for future research.  Graduate students will gain insights and perspectives that may be lacking at their home institutions.  Postdoctoral scholars, recent Ph.D.'s, and researchers at institutions where teaching is the primary focus, will bring to their professions an enhanced enthusiasm for research and a better understanding of important recent developments in algebra.]]></AbstractNarration>
