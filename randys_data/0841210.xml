<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs (NSF/OPP), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of Space Communications (NASA/HQ Code OT), initiated a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in September, 1993, that established spacecraft tracking and data acquisition capability at the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) McMurdo Station research facility.  The primary initial mission supported by the agreement was the acquisition of RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite remote sensing imagery from a 10 meter antenna ground tracking station constructed for this purpose.  Pursuant to the MOA, NSF supports operations and maintenance and utilizes the assistance of NASA Wallops Flight Facility (NASA/WFF) to discharge this responsibility.  NSF provides funding to NASA/WFF to supply on-continent personnel for MGS operations and maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASA confirmed the continued acquisition of RADARSAT-1 data through the completion of the RADARSAT-1 support agreement with the Canadian Space Agency, which concludes in April, 2008.   NASA further anticipates a continued need of the MGS for NASA Ground Network operations beyond the cessation of the RADARSAT-1 mission.  Continuation of the MGS will be subject to a renegotiation of the governing MOA terms and conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new interagency agreement will be implemented to replace the original agreement implemented under award #9628886 due to the age of the original agreement.  This new support agreement prepared by NSF/OPP has been negotiated with NASA/GSFC/Code 453 to define levels of support and funding for Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASA has proposed a FY07 budget totaling $174,784 in direct funding and an amount not to exceed $15,000 for NSF logistics support (airline tickets, chargeable O&amp;M support, etc.) and $5,000 for local McMurdo logistics/supplies.  NASA has proposed a FY08 budget totaling $179,122 in direct funding and an amount not to exceed $15,000 for NSF logistics support (airline tickets, chargeable O&amp;M support, etc.) and $5,000 for local McMurdo logistics/supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed annual funding continuation totaling $353,906 is recommended for award to NASA/GSFC.  Prior awards (direct funding only) under the prior interagency funding agreement have totaled $3,732,179 to NASA for this activity.  The annual award under the new interagency agreement will restart the cumulative tracking at the recommended award funding of $353,906. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
