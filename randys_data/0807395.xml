<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Cook&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807395&lt;br/&gt;McKinley&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807330&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In this collaborative project, the investigators and a&lt;br/&gt;colleague study the motion of complex fluids, especially flows of&lt;br/&gt;wormlike micellar fluids and of monodisperse polymer solutions in&lt;br/&gt;a variety of geometries and under a variety of forcings. &lt;br/&gt;Surfactant systems consist of amphiphilic molecules with&lt;br/&gt;hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails.  Under suitable chemical&lt;br/&gt;conditions these molecules can self-assemble in aqueous solution&lt;br/&gt;into long aggregates known as worm-like micelles.  These long&lt;br/&gt;flexible structures entangle to form a network and lead to&lt;br/&gt;viscoelastic properties similar to those of polymer melts and&lt;br/&gt;concentrated solutions, but with the added complexity that the&lt;br/&gt;worms continuously break and reform (i.e. they are "living&lt;br/&gt;polymers").  External deformations can enhance the local rate of&lt;br/&gt;micellar breakage, thus the macroscopic flow affects the&lt;br/&gt;microscopic structure which in turn further modifies the global&lt;br/&gt;velocity field.  Due to these multi-scale interactions these&lt;br/&gt;fluids exhibit flow inhomogeneities even in simple geometries. &lt;br/&gt;Development and analysis of new constitutive models and&lt;br/&gt;comparison with experimental results is generating new insight&lt;br/&gt;and understanding into the multi-scale nature of these flows and&lt;br/&gt;of the influence of the evolution in the microscopic structure on&lt;br/&gt;the macroscopic measurables.  The governing mathematics is that&lt;br/&gt;of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;describing conservation of mass and linear momentum, coupled to&lt;br/&gt;equations governing the number densities of the entangled&lt;br/&gt;molecules and constitutive (stress) equations for each species. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the investigators study a pair of two-species&lt;br/&gt;network models that they recently proposed: a two species model&lt;br/&gt;with chain scission and reforming effects (the VCM model)&lt;br/&gt;physically appropriate for wormlike micellar solutions, and a&lt;br/&gt;simplified non-interacting model (PEC+M model) appropriate to&lt;br/&gt;monodisperse entangled polymer solutions.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;study the time evolution of the solutions in strong extensional&lt;br/&gt;flow and in rapidly time-varying flow using a combination of&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics and computation as well as experiments.  Approximate&lt;br/&gt;closed form solutions are generated to enable an understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the flows and of sharp spatial transitions (microstructural&lt;br/&gt;boundary layers). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators study the material properties of complex&lt;br/&gt;fluids such as those constituting shampoos, liquid detergents,&lt;br/&gt;molten plastics, and fluids utilized in enhanced oil recovery. &lt;br/&gt;On the microscopic scale these polymeric fluids consist of large&lt;br/&gt;aggregates or macromolecules and the shape and orientation of&lt;br/&gt;these molecules control the properties of the fluid and how it&lt;br/&gt;performs in the desired application.  It is very difficult to&lt;br/&gt;characterize these fluids experimentally because their flow&lt;br/&gt;properties, unlike those of Newtonian fluids such as water,&lt;br/&gt;become inhomogeneous even in simple geometries.  This means that&lt;br/&gt;the usual types of measurements (in which the fluid properties&lt;br/&gt;are measured at the flow boundaries) are not sufficient to&lt;br/&gt;understand and characterize the material response.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigators have formulated a new equation of state -- a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model -- that more fully describes the&lt;br/&gt;microstructural properties of these fluids and how they flow. &lt;br/&gt;They now investigate the predictions of this model in various&lt;br/&gt;complex flows and compare this with experimental findings.  This&lt;br/&gt;in turn enables them to develop new means to probe and&lt;br/&gt;characterize the properties of the fluids.  The complex fluids&lt;br/&gt;listed above are used commercially in a variety of geometries&lt;br/&gt;that may involve both stretching flows (such as the motion of a&lt;br/&gt;jet, flow out of a nozzle) as well as shearing flows (for example&lt;br/&gt;pumping of the fluids in a pipe).  To ensure that their&lt;br/&gt;analytical and experimental results are relevant to researchers&lt;br/&gt;in industry, the investigators investigate both steady and&lt;br/&gt;time-dependent examples of both types of flow conditions.]]></AbstractNarration>
