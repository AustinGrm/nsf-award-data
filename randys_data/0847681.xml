<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). At the forefront of condensed matter physics, the design and development of new materials has been the root of many fundamental discoveries. The ability to predict and synthesize targeted compounds represents one of the main challenges of our understanding of the relations between the chemistry, crystal structure and physical properties in complex solids. This NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports experimental investigations and education in condensed matter physics, with focus on itinerant electron magnets. The main goals of this project are (i) the design and synthesis of novel itinerant magnetic systems and (ii) the study how itinerant magnetism is affected by spin fluctuations: Are spin fluctuations responsible for non-Fermi liquid behavior in these systems? What are the mechanisms responsible for quantum critical behavior in itinerant electron systems? How do these spin fluctuations break the degeneracy of competing instabilities like magnetism and superconductivity? By tuning the magnetic phase transitions to a quantum critical point (QCP) by composition, pressure or magnetic field, the newly discovered itinerant magnetic systems will be used to answer each of these fundamental questions. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project will be trained in crystal growth and characterization, valuable tools for materials driven condensed matter research. The PI will incorporate her research expertise into a new graduate-level course focused on modern problems in magnetism and magnetic materials. The PI's laboratory resources will be used to illustrate some aspects of this course. In addition, high school teachers will be involved in summer research in the PI's laboratory, an experience that, in turn, can have a great impact on a large number of students and guide them towards future careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). At the forefront of condensed matter physics, the design and development of new materials has been the root of many fundamental discoveries. This NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports experimental investigations and education in condensed matter physics, with focus on novel magnetic states of matter. The main goals of this project are (i) the design and synthesis of novel exotic magnetic systems and (ii) the study of their physical properties. Although magnetism has been studied since antiquity, many fundamental questions remain unanswered about unconventional magnetic compounds. In particular it is of great interest to understand what happens as the temperature is lowered close to absolute zero, or towards quantum phase transitions (QPT). These are fundamentally different than the more familiar phase transitions, for example liquid-to-solid as water freezes. In the case of quantum phase transitions, quantum and not thermal fluctuations are now at play. It is crucial to understand such transitions and the role of quantum fluctuations, since unconventional superconductivity and other exotic phases are believed to emerge from QPT. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project will be trained in crystal growth and characterization, valuable tools for materials driven condensed matter research. The PI will incorporate her research expertise into a new graduate-level course focused on modern problems in magnetism and magnetic materials. The PI's laboratory resources will be used to illustrate some aspects of this course. In addition, high school teachers will be involved in summer research in the PI's laboratory, an experience that, in turn, can have a great impact on a large number of students and guide them towards future careers in science.]]></AbstractNarration>
