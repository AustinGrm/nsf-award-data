<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[0849174&lt;br/&gt;Raja&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  U.S.-Malaysia Workshop on High-capacity Optical-networks Test and Monitoring (HOTM)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American researchers, postdocs, and graduate students in a U.S.- Malaysian workshop to be held in Penang, Malaysia in November 2008.  The co-organizers are Professor Yasin Raja of the Department of Physics and Optical Science at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and Professor Rosni Abdullah in the School of Computer Sciences at the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang. The workshop will address a very crucial area that is very much needed in response to the growth of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) Networks at national and global levels.  They will discuss the aspects of test and monitoring of high-capacity, high-throughput and high-speed communications networks with heterogeneous traffic.  Such test and monitoring has several objectives, including reliability, security capacity and bandwidth utilization, etc.  The growth and proliferation of high-capacity optical networks has skyrocketed over the past decade and continues even at a higher pace.  The technical community is facing enormous challenges regarding Next Generation Internet.  While the amount of data being generated on a daily basis continues to rise at alarming rates, the need for more efficient and deterministic network architecture and protocols is becoming more than ever evident.  The topics to be discussed are in pertinent areas relating to the development and utilization of high-speed Internet, Network Security, e-education, and e-Governance infrastructure.  This includes optical core and metro networks, optical access technologies, passive optical networks (PON), hybrid optical/wireless internetworking, network security issues, sensor networks, and e-applications using high-speed communication networks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is sufficient overlap of interests between the University of North Carolina and the Universiti Sains Malaysia to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed and that the interaction will benefit both sides.  This workshop will provide the participating US postdocs and graduate students an excellent opportunity to receive a global research experience.  It is anticipated that they will maintain contacts and collaborations with the Malaysian researchers and students throughout their careers.  Information about the workshop and its findings will be made available via the website; www.honet-ict.org]]></AbstractNarration>
