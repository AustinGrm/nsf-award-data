# Directorates

There are 13 distinct directorates:

1.  Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering
2.  Directorate for Geosciences
3.  Directorate for Engineering
4.  Directorate for Biological Sciences
5.  Directorate for Social Behavioral & Economic Sciences
6.  Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences
7.  Directorate for Education & Human Resources
8.  OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
9.  Office of Polar Programs
10. Office of Information & Resource Management
11. Office of Budget Finance & Award Management
12. National Coordination Office
13. National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office

Although if we consider offices and directorates separately, there are actually
only 7 distinct directorates, and there are 6 distinct offices.

Additionally, there are cases where no directorate is listed. In these cases, a
division may or may not be listed. In fact, the number of programs/divisions
this accounts for seems to be small. The instances are summarized below.

divs                                 pgms
------                               ------
(none)                               1496
DIVISION OF MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT    7258
NATIONAL SCIENCE BOARD               {042P 042p 0626 9170}
Office of Inspector General          {0216 0300 0608 0627 0634 0658 0675 7955 9170}

TODO: the results above show that program IDs really need to be capitalized.
Notice that '042P' and '042p' both show up, but these are really the same.

TODO: are some divisions completely unassigned or are all cases simply a
directorate tag just being left blank accidentally?
